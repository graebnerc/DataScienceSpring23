# Exercises on multiple linear regression

## Studying coffee data

Read in the data set [coffee_data.csv](coffee_data.csv). 

It contains the following variables:

* `CoffeePrice`: The world market price for coffee from Brazil in EUR per kilo 
* `CoffeeDemand`: The demand for coffee from Brazil in tons
* `CoffeeSeller`: The kind of coffee company: `Standard` or `FairTrade`

In the following, treat `CoffeeDemand` as the dependent variable, 
and `CoffeePrice` and `CoffeeSeller` as the independent variables.

Estimate a parallel slopes model, and an interaction model.
Which of the models would you prefer? 

You should justify your choice using two main arguments.

## Exploring feasible model specifications

Read in the data set [ice_data.csv](ice_data.csv).
What kind of relationships could you reasonably study in a linear regression
framework (without further data transformation).
