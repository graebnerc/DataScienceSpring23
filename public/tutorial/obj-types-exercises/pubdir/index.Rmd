# Task 1
Create a vector containing the numbers `2`, `5`, `2.4` and `11.` 

1. What is the type of this vector?
2. Replace the second element with `5.9`.
3. Add the elements `3` and `1` to the beginning, and the elements `"8.0"` and 
`"9.2"` to the end of the vector.
4. Transform this vector into the type integer. What happens?

# Task 2
1. What type is the following vector: `"2"`, `"Hello"`, `4.0`, and `TRUE` 
2. What hierarchy is underlying this?

# Task 3
1. Create a vector with the numbers from `-8` to `9` (step size: `0.5`)
2. Compute the square root of each element of the first vector using vectorisation. 
Anything that draws your attention?

# Task 4
Create a list that has three named elements: `"A"`, `"B"`, and `"C"`

* The element `"A"` should contain the square root of the numbers form -2 to 8 (step size: `1`)
* The element `"B"` should contain the log of numbers between 2 and 4 (step size: `0.5`)
* The element `"C"` should contain letters from `a1` to `g7` (hint: use the pre-defined vector `letters` and the function `paste()`)
